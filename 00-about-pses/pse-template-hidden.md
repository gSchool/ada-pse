# Week X: Problem Name

## Given this problem prompt:

Imagine working on software that `<TEMPLATE: has some specific kind of purpose and context>`. Create a method that `<TEMPLATE: is responsible for what, as a high-level goal?>`. This method should take in `<TEMPLATE: specify data type and what it represents. This needs to be flexible, as question 2 of the PSE is to come up with 2 examples of input>` as parameters. This method should have a return value of `<TEMPLATE: description of output>`.

## Answer the following prompts:

1. List at least 5 questions whose answers would clarify the problem statement
1. List 2 sets of example inputs (method parameters) and their expected output (method return values)
1. Divide the project prompt into at least 2 different sub-problems
1. Pick one of those problems from #3 and write a numbered list explaining how to solve that problem without using full lines of code
1. Write down on paper a solution for your answer in #4 in code

## Reminders

- You must write your name on your PSE.
- Finish this on paper individually.
- The instructor will collect this at the beginning of the next lesson.
- If you'd like a full list of our tips, hints, and notes, please bring up the document ["About Problem Solving Exercises" in the textbook curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/master/00-programming-fundamentals/about-problem-solving-exercises.md).

### How to Give Feedback on this PSE

#### Reviewing #1 (list at least 5 questions):

No. 1 is used to stretch minds. It should feel like a lot of questions, and it should be really hard! Most questions are still valid even if these questions challenge very basic assumptions, like "is this a running Ruby script?" or "is this on a computer?"

- The answer is wrong if there aren't at least 5 questions
- The answer is wrong if there were no questions clarifying `<TEMPLATE: FILL THIS OUT. What is a subject that they should DEFINITELY clarify?>`

#### Reviewing #2 (2 example input/output):

- The answer is wrong if there aren't 2 examples
- The answer is wrong if either of them aren't valid/consistent with each other
- The answer is wrong if the example inputs were not `<TEMPLATE: FILL THIS OUT if the problem statement specifies a data type and structure of the input>`
- The answer is wrong if the example outputs were not `<TEMPLATE: FILL THIS OUT if the problem statement specifies a data type and structure of the output>`

#### Reviewing #3 (2 sub-problems):

- The answer is wrong if there aren't at least 2 sub-problems listed
- The answer is wrong if any of the sub-problems aren't relevant to the original problem

#### Reviewing #4 (List of steps to solve one sub-problem):

- The answer is wrong if it doesn't have at least two steps
- The answer is wrong if it doesn't make sense

#### Reviewing #5 (Code for solving one sub-problem):

The point of this exercise is not fully check if the code is correct at the moment, but to let them practice writing code with their hands.

- The answer is wrong if it is blank
- The answer is wrong if it is obviously incorrect code (ie you wrote `puts "Oops!"` for your entire response)
